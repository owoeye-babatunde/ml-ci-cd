  -R, --recursive       If any target is a directory, recursively search and

  --json                Show output in JSON format.
  --md                  Show tabulated output in the Markdown format (GFM).
  --no-path             Don't show metric path.
  --precision <n>       Round metrics to `n` digits precision after the
                        decimal point. Rounds to 5 digits by default.
